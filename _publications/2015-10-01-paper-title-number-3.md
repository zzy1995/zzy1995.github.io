Collaboration with Imran Adham and Jesus De Loera.

We improved the performance of two algorithmic case studies: the selection of a pivot rule for the Simplex method and the selection of an all-pair shortest paths algorithm. Multilayer perceptron and gradient boosted tree models were trained in these experiments.
